## App Review Notes Template

```
OperatorKit is a productivity assistant that:

1. Processes all AI operations on-device using Apple Foundation Models
2. Requires explicit user approval before any action executes
3. Does not collect or transmit user content to external servers

Security Architecture:
- No WebKit/JavaScriptCore frameworks linked
- No background task execution
- Optional sync (disabled by default) transmits settings only

Verification:
The app includes a "Trust Dashboard" where users can verify security 
claims and export proof artifacts. All claims are backed by testable 
evidence.

## Localization Notes

When translating, maintain:
- "On-device" concept (not "cloud-free")
- "Draft-first" workflow description
- "Approval-gated" meaning (user action required)
- "Verifiable" (evidence-based, not promise-based)

Avoid translating to phrases that imply absolute security guarantees.
